Description:
This project will make use of Django to generate a dynamic form website, which will collect all details required for making a resume like Scholastic Achievements, Key Projects, PORs etc.
This will involve dealing with dynamic forms which can include headings, multiple sub-headings and sub-sub-headings. For, handling this, we will use Django Framework and other Python libraries. This form will, at the end, generate a LaTEX script which can be used to generate Resume. Will use Bootstrap for front-end design.
Here, we will deal with all standard resume formats used at IITB(2-3 types of 2-page resume and 2-3 types of 1-page resume) to give user a choice of format 

This project can serve institute and can help reduce time required to make resume.
