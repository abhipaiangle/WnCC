Description:
This project is for the people interested in exploring front-end web development and learning Data Structures and Algorithms. The final goal of this project is to build a webpage for visualizing different pathfinding(e.g. A*, Dijkstra, BFS and DFS) and sorting algorithms. This would be done using HTML, CSS and JS. The source of this idea is the given project[https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer). 

The first 3-4 weeks of the project phase would be a learning phase, wherein the students would learn the basic data structures and algorithms and learn how to create dynamic webpages is built using HTML, CSS and JS. During this learning phase, the students have to complete certain regular checkpoints.

The last 1-2 weeks would focus solely on the the ideation and implementation of the webpage.

Students applying of this project should know the basics of programming especially object-oriented programming and of course enthu!
